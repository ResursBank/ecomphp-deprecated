# resursbank/ecomphp-deprecated #

This is a repository for revoked content of primarily ECOMPHP v1.3.
To make it easier to transform the currently broken support of PSR-4, a try to separate the most obsolete parts from the release first and hereafter import compatiblity from this library instead. For those who still use older classes and definitions that belongs to the broken class handling, we'd like to give a chance to replace that data before upgrading to something newer.

### How do I get set up? ###

Use composer as usual.

    composer install resursbank/ecomphp

When reaching a specific version of v1.3, this library will be imported automatically.

### Who do I talk to about this? ###

Resurs Bank AB via onboarding@resurs.se
